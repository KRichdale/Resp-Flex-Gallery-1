# Resp-Flex-Gallery-1

First responsive flex box gallery attempt.
Happy with device transistions.

Flex box seems to streamline the process and make things much easier positioning wise. Loving the tool.


<h3> Problems </h3>

Fixing the bottom alignment of all the photos seems to be frustrating. Correcting this will be a large lesson i need too learn.

I should also be pushing <strong>more blocks</strong> of code into github instead of just the entirety of the project in one go.(Simulate workplace enviroment)
